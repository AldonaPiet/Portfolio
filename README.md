# About me 👋
Hi! 

I'm Aldona.

I decided to become a tester.

I gained my first experience in QA thanks to Dare IT challenges: Automatic  Tests + Python:

<a href = "https://github.com/AldonaPiet/challenge_portfolio_aldona"> Selenium Webdriver + Python </a>

<a href = "https://github.com/AldonaPiet/challengerobotframework"> Robot Framework </a>

I passed ISTQB FL exam and now am working to get some practical skills using my knowledge of Python & Robot Framework.

During my studies (Physics) I took scientific and programming courses, learned analytical and critical thinking. 

I like getting new knowledge and I have no problem with familiarizing myself with new tools.

I’m a detail-oriented, energetic person with, a can do attitude 💪. I’m also assertive team player and believe all problems should be resolved smoothly and diplomatically.

I think that my innate traits and soft skills cultivated over years of my carieer tightly connected to people in an international environment, make me a good tester to-be.
I'm well aware that character traits are not enough so I work hard to get more skills that decent tester should have 🙂.


I am looking for the position of junior/trainee tester.

In my free time I like walking, playing piano or playing with my cat (OK, playing with the cat is a must - she would not let it slide 😉). I also like reading manga, watching anime and asian series.
