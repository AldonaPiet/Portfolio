## About me
I studied physics and I was studying astronomy too. During my studies I took scientific and programming courses. After years of work with people in an international environment, I can tell that I’m advanced in the primary programming language: English ;) 

I’m a proactive, energetic person with a can do attitude. I’m also assertive team player and believe all problems should be resolved smoothly and diplomatically. 

Currently, to get practical skills, I do Dare IT challenges: 
Automatic Tests + Python.

### ....and privately
In my free time I like walking, playing piano or playing with my cat (OK, playing with a cat is a must - she would not let it slide ;)
